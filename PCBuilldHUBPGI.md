# Project General Information

Group Name: Group 6
Project Title: PC Build Hub

## A. Problem Statement:
Building a PC is highly technical, especially in terms of the compatibility of parts. Most beginners get stuck on choosing the appropriate components and assembling their PCs. Moreover, there are few reliable local resources that one can turn to when buying computer parts and getting advice, especially around North Caloocan, Philippines. Some of the common problems include; []

• Confusion about the compatibility of the component.
• Lack of availability of reliable and trusted local vendors.
• Lack of proper assembly instructions in detail and resulting in mistakes while building it.

## B. Project Description:
PC Build Hub is an all-in-one ecommerce platform where users can buy PC parts and receive step-by-step video tutorials to guide them through assembling their components. The app aims to simplify the PC-building process by offering a tool to check component compatibility, provide personalized build suggestions, and allow users to purchase all necessary parts from a trusted marketplace. The system will cater to both beginners and experienced PC builders.

## C. Project Objectives:
To develop the PC Build Hub App that will help manage the PC building process with the following features:

1.A comprehensive parts catalog with real-time pricing and availability
2.A build configurator tool to ensure compatibility of selected components
3.Step-by-step video tutorials to guide users in building their PC
4.Secure online payment and order tracking system
5.User profiles with saved builds and wishlists
6.Community forums for advice and support

## D. Business Benefits:

1.Provide a streamlined, all-in-one solution for PC building, from purchasing to assembly.
2.Increase accessibility for beginners through video tutorials, reducing build mistakes.
3.Create a local marketplace for reliable PC parts in North Caloocan, increasing customer trust.
4.Reduce return rates by ensuring component compatibility before purchase.

## E. Project Deliverables:
1. Requirements
Research and Analysis: Gather insights on PC building and ecommerce systems.
Data Gathering: Collect information on PC components, user needs, and market trends.
User Stories: Define user interactions with the system (customers, admins).
User Requirements: Detail system needs from the perspective of end-users.
Use Case: Identify core actions (e.g., purchasing components, managing inventory).
Data Dictionary: Document all fields and data types for each database table.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visualize relationships between system entities (users, orders, components).
Dataflow Diagram: Outline how data moves between modules within the system.

2. Design
Low-Fidelity Mockups: Initial wireframes showing basic layout and navigation.
High-Fidelity Designs: Detailed designs with visual elements, colors, and branding.
Prototype: Interactive demo to simulate core system functions for user feedback.

3. Development
Frontend: Build user interfaces using Angular, ensuring a responsive design.
Backend: Develop the system’s logic, including database handling and API integration.
Database Setup: Implement the database structure to support user, order, and component data.

4. Testing
Functional Testing: Verify core functions (e.g., orders, inventory, and user logins).
Non-Functional Testing: Test system performance, security, and usability.

5. Deployment
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct UAT with real users to validate the system.
System Launch: Deploy the system to the production environment for public use.

## F. Benchmarking
  1. PCPartPicker – for build configurator and compatibility checking system

## G. Estimated Project Duration:
The project is estimated to take 6 months to complete, with 1 month dedicated to research and requirements gathering, 2 months to design and prototyping, 2 months to development, and 1 month for testing and deployment.
