# Project General Information

Group Name: Group 6
Project Title: PC Build Hub

## A. Problem Statement:
Building a PC requires technical knowledge, especially regarding the compatibility of parts. Many beginners struggle with choosing the right components, ensuring compatibility, and assembling their PC. There is also a lack of reliable local resources to purchase PC parts and receive guidance, especially in North Caloocan, Philippines.

## B. Project Description:
PC Build Hub is an all-in-one ecommerce platform where users can buy PC parts and receive step-by-step video tutorials to guide them through assembling their components. The app aims to simplify the PC-building process by offering a tool to check component compatibility, provide personalized build suggestions, and allow users to purchase all necessary parts from a trusted marketplace. The system will cater to both beginners and experienced PC builders.

## C. Project Objectives:
To develop the PC Build Hub App that will help manage the PC building process with the following features:

1.A comprehensive parts catalog with real-time pricing and availability
2.A build configurator tool to ensure compatibility of selected components
3.Step-by-step video tutorials to guide users in building their PC
4.Secure online payment and order tracking system
5.User profiles with saved builds and wishlists
6.Community forums for advice and support

## D. Business Benefits:

1.Provide a streamlined, all-in-one solution for PC building, from purchasing to assembly.
2.Increase accessibility for beginners through video tutorials, reducing build mistakes.
3.Create a local marketplace for reliable PC parts in North Caloocan, increasing customer trust.
4.Reduce return rates by ensuring component compatibility before purchase.

## E. Project Deliverables:

1. Requirements
Research and Analysis: Gather insights on PC building and ecommerce systems.
Data Gathering: Collect information on PC components, user needs, and market trends.
User Stories: Define user interactions with the system (customers, admins).
User Requirements: Detail system needs from the perspective of end-users.
Use Case: Identify core actions (e.g., purchasing components, managing inventory).
Data Dictionary: Document all fields and data types for each database table.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visualize relationships between system entities (users, orders, components).
Dataflow Diagram: Outline how data moves between modules within the system.

2. Design
Low-Fidelity Mockups: Initial wireframes showing basic layout and navigation.
High-Fidelity Designs: Detailed designs with visual elements, colors, and branding.
Prototype: Interactive demo to simulate core system functions for user feedback.

3. Development
Frontend: Build user interfaces using Angular, ensuring a responsive design.
Backend: Develop the system’s logic, including database handling and API integration.
Database Setup: Implement the database structure to support user, order, and component data.

4. Testing
Functional Testing: Verify core functions (e.g., orders, inventory, and user logins).
Non-Functional Testing: Test system performance, security, and usability.

5. Deployment
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct UAT with real users to validate the system.
System Launch: Deploy the system to the production environment for public use.

## F. Benchmarking
  1. PCPartPicker – for build configurator and compatibility checking system

## G. Estimated Project Duration:
The project is estimated to take 6 months to complete, with 1 month dedicated to research and requirements gathering, 2 months to design and prototyping, 2 months to development, and 1 month for testing and deployment.
